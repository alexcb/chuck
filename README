Tool for hosting files over http

To host a file (or directory) run:

   ./chuck.py --port 9999 <path>

If <path> is a directory, then chuck.py will compress host the entire directory as a zip file.

This will allow users to visit http://localhost:9999 which will cause the file located at path to be downloaded

Alternatively if a user already has chuck installed on the receiving computer; one may run:

   ./chuck.py --list

to discover all running chuck servers on the local network.


Example of using chuck to share a copy of itself:

    ./chuck.py chuck.py

This will output:

   serving on http://192.168.0.103:9999

Open this URL in a browser and chuck.py will be downloaded; alternatively on the command line this can be downloaded with wget:

    wget --content-disposition http://192.168.0.103:9999

which will save it as chuck.py
